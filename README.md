## Design Patterns

### Creational Pattern:
1. Factory Method (P):

2. Singleton (A):


### Structural Pattern:
1. Adapter (P):

2. Decorator (A):


### Behavioural Pattern:
1. Strategy (P):

2. Observer (A):
   Implemented in `frontend/ObserverPattern`. The **Observer** pattern dynamically tracks game progress through the `GameProgress` class, which acts as the **Subject**.

- **ConsoleObserver** listens for updates and provides real-time feedback in the console.
- Integrated into `GameUI` to track guesses, remaining attempts, and game outcomes.
